### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy Grove, a software engineer specializing in distributed systems and query engines. I am the author of the book [How Query Engines Work](https://leanpub.com/how-query-engines-work).

### Work

I work for NVIDIA where I contribute to the [RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids), which is an open source plugin that provides GPU-acceleration for ETL workloads, leveraging the [RAPIDS cuDF GPU DataFrame library](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf).

### Open Source

- I am a PMC member of [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/), where I donated the initial Rust implementation and later donated the DataFusion query engine.
- I believe that Rust and Apache Arrow together provide a great foundation for distributed systems and I created [Ballista Distributed Compute](https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista) platform to demonstrate the possibilities.

### Hobbies

I occasionally work on hobby projects involving digital electronics, microcontrollers, woodworking, and similar skills. Some of my projects have been featured on popular "maker" web sites.
