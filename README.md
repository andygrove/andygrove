### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy Grove, a software engineer specializing in distributed systems and query engines. I am the author of the book [How Query Engines Work](https://leanpub.com/how-query-engines-work).

### Work

I work for NVIDIA where I contribute to the [RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids), which is an open source plugin that provides GPU-acceleration for ETL workloads.

### Open Source

- I am a PMC member of [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/), where I donated the initial Rust implementation as well as the DataFusion query engine.
- I believe that the next generation of distributed systems will be built on Apache Arrow and I created the [Ballista Distributed Compute](https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista) platform to demonstrate the possibilities.
