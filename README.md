### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy Grove, a software engineer specializing in distributed systems and query engines. I am the author of the book [How Query Engines Work](https://leanpub.com/how-query-engines-work).

### Career

I work for NVIDIA where I contribute to the [RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids), which is an open source plugin that provides GPU-acceleration for ETL workloads, leveraging the [RAPIDS cuDF GPU DataFrame library](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf).

I am also helping the NVIDIA [Dask SQL](https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-sql) team integrate [DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion) for query planning and optimizations.


### Open Source

I am a PMC member and active contributor in the [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/) project, where I have made the following donations:

- In 2018, I donated the [Rust implementation of Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs)
- In 2019, I donated the [DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion) in-process SQL query engine
- In 2021, I donated the [Ballista](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista) distributed SQL query engine

I am also the original author of the [sqlparser-rs](https://github.com/sqlparser-rs/sqlparser-rs) crate.

### Hobbies

I occasionally work on hobby projects involving digital electronics, microcontrollers, woodworking, and similar skills. Some of my projects have been featured on popular "maker" web sites.
