### Career

I work for NVIDIA where I contribute to the [RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids), which is an open source plugin that provides GPU-acceleration for ETL workloads, leveraging the [RAPIDS cuDF GPU DataFrame library](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf).
